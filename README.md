# My First Flutter Project

This is my first Flutter project, and I'm just getting started with Flutter development. It's a work in progress, and I'm learning as I go along.

## Project Description

This project is a basic Flutter app that I'm using to practice and learn how to build mobile applications. I'm starting from scratch and working on different features step by step.

## What I've Done So Far

- Created a new Flutter project.
- Modified the default counter app to experiment with widgets and layouts.
- Added a basic navigation structure to switch between screens.
- Learned how to use Flutter's hot reload feature for rapid development.

## What I Plan to Learn

I'm excited about my journey with Flutter, and here's what I plan to learn next:

- Working with state management in Flutter.
- Fetching data from APIs and displaying it in the app.
- Creating custom widgets and layouts.
- Implementing user authentication.

## How to Run the App

To run this app on your machine, make sure you have Flutter and Dart installed. Then, follow these steps:

1. Clone this project to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-first-flutter-project.git

    Navigate to the project directory:

bash

cd my-first-flutter-project

    Run the project using Flutter:

bash

flutter run

    You should see the app running on your emulator or physical device.
